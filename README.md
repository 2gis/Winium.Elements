This is a set of extensions for [WebDriver C# bindings](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver/) providing easy-to-use way of interacting with desktop-specific UI elements in Windows Desktop apps tested with Winium.Desktop.

## How it works
Winium.Elements extends OpenQA.Selenium bindings adding Winium.Desktop driver commands.
