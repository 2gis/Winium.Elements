</p>

This is a set of extensions for [WebDriver Language Bindings](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) providing easy-to-use way of interacting with desktop-specific UI elements in Windows Desktop apps tested with Winium.Desktop.

With the help of Winium.Elements you could simplify interaction with such complex elements like DataGrid, ComboBox, Menu and etc.

## Quick Start (.net example)
1. Add reference to `Winium.Elements.Desktop` in UI test project ([install NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Winium.Elements.Desktop/)).
2. Find element and convert it to [ElementType] using To[ElementType] method.
	
	```cs
	var element = driver.FindElementById("data_grid");
	var dataGrid = element.ToDataGrid();
	```
	Use element specific extension methods, for example:
	```cs
	var cell = dataGrid.Find(1, 1);
	Assert.AreEqual("expected cell text", cell.Text);
	```

## How it works
Winium.Elements extends OpenQA.Selenium bindings adding Winium.Desktop driver commands.
